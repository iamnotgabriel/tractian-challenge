# CHALLENGE

## Context
Our users, Emerson and Roberta, are maintenance managers at Industria Freios Supremos (auto parts manufacturer), and they have 2 units and 10 assets (machines) in total. They would like to be able to register and view both the units separately, as well as have an overview that condenses the data from the two units.
